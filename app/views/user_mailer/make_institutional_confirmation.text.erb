New Internationalist Magazine - Instutition Account
===================================================

<%= @greeting %> <%= @user.username %>,
You've now been made an Institutional user.
This means you have the power to create 'student' user
accounts which will share your subscription.

Feel free to create a couple of them, perhaps one for
staff and one for students.

To do this, follow the link below and then on your user-page click the button that says 
'Create a new student account':
<%= user_url(@user, :protocol => "https") %>

Now you can share the username and password of the
student account you created with the school.

Great, now you can start reading!
<%= issues_url(:protocol => "https") %>

For future reference, your username is: <%= @user.username %>

<% if @user.subscriber? and @user.is_recurring? %>
Your next auto-debit will be on:
<% else %>
Your subscription is due for renewal:
<% end %>
<% if @user.paper_only_subscription_valid? %>
<%= @user.expiry_date_paper_only.try(:strftime, "%e %B, %Y") %>
We've also given you a free 3-month trial to the digital edition, which will expire on:
<%= @user.expiry_date.try(:strftime, "%e %B, %Y") %>
<% else %>
<%= @user.expiry_date.try(:strftime, "%e %B, %Y") %>

<% end %>
If you come across any problems, simply hit 'reply' to this
email and we'll reply as soon as we can.

NOTE: please don't share your main account with
anyone, as they can then edit your details.

Cheers, the NI team.

New Internationalist Subscription - Outstanding payment
=====================================================

<%= @greeting %> Helen,
Looks like one of our recurring subscribers has paid an outstanding payment, so maybe check to see if the system updated their subscription okay here:

<%= admin_user_url(@user) %>

<% if @user.expiry_date %>
Their subscription expiry date is:
<%= @user.expiry_date.strftime("%e %B, %Y") %>
<% end %>

This is an automated email, but feel free to ask me any questions about it. :-)

Cheers, Simon.

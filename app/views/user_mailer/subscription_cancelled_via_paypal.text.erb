New Internationalist Subscription - Cancelled
=============================================

<%= @greeting %> <%= @user.username %>,
Your automatic-renewal has now been cancelled via PayPal.
Sorry to see you go! Please let us know if it's something
we did or how we could improve this service.

In the meantime your subscription will continue until your most recent subscription payment runs out, so you can still read magazines at:
<%= issues_url(:protocol => "https") %>

<% if @user.expiry_date %>
Your subscription expiry date is:
<%= @user.expiry_date.strftime("%e %B, %Y") %>
<% end %>

Cheers, the NI team.
